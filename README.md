# Terraform-ACI-modules
This example covers how to build an ACI fabric leveraging modules.

# Terraform ACI Modules

From the Terraform documentation, A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. Modules can be used to create lightweight abstractions, so that you can describe your infrastructure in terms of its architecture, rather than directly in terms of physical objects.

In order to showcase the power of modules, we will be creating and deploying the following new objects:

* Tenant
* VRF
* Bridge Domains
